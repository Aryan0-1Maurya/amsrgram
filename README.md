## Case Study

### **Role**
Web Development

### **Responsibilities**
Structure & Design / Firebase Integration / Authentication / Research & Optimization

### **Challenge**

The previous version of the application suffered from poor code quality, particularly in its state management. Additionally, the method for handling posts was slow and outdated. The state management issue was particularly problematic, as deleted posts persisted in the database, resulting in unnecessary data storage costs that could have had severe financial implications for the company.

After a thorough analysis of the client's current situation and technological needs, it became evident that a comprehensive overhaul of the state management system was imperative.

### **Process**

Following a detailed examination of the old code, the recommended course of action was a complete rewrite of the application, guided by a human-centered design philosophy throughout the design and development process. This solution was agreed upon by the client.

Development hinged on a plan crafted in collaboration with the owners, encompassing the addition of new features, a redesign, and the implementation of an updated state management system. Ongoing support and maintenance were integral components of this process.

During testing, client feedback from end-users was collected and incorporated into the iterative development process. The final stages involved providing assistance and support for the implementation of the application.

Key technologies employed during the development included React, Firebase, and Tailwind. Custom hooks, dynamic and protected routes, as well as implemented authentication, were integral to the project.

### **Outcome**

The resulting application, named AmsrGram, boasts enhanced speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness in maintenance. The rewrite not only increased scalability but also introduced a visually appealing design. Notably, the revision of the state management system and the elimination of unnecessary data storage led to a substantial 35% reduction in data management expenses for the company.

**Note**
The application is currently in the testing phase and hasn't been deployed at the client's company. However, a fully functional demo/testing version is available for exploration.
